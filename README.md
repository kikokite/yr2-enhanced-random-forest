🧩 Enhanced Random Forest

Random Forest classifier improvement — a supervised learning project focused on handling class imbalance by incorporating balanced class weights.

Authors: Francisco Carqueija, Marta Longo, Sara Táboas

📘 Project Overview
This project enhances the standard Random Forest algorithm to better handle imbalanced datasets. It investigates how class weighting affects predictions and evaluates the model using standard classification metrics.

🎯 Objectives
	•	Analyze Random Forest performance on benchmark datasets.
	•	Investigate the effect of class imbalance on model predictions.
	•	Implement balanced class weights to improve minority class predictions.
	•	Compare results with standard Random Forest using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and balanced accuracy.
