## 📘 Project Overview
This project enhances the standard Random Forest algorithm to better handle imbalanced datasets. It investigates how class weighting affects predictions and evaluates the model using standard classification metrics.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze Random Forest performance on benchmark datasets.
- Investigate the effect of class imbalance on model predictions.
- Implement balanced class weights to improve minority class predictions.
- Compare results with standard Random Forest using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and balanced accuracy.
